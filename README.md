# Exam 2 Take-Home Project

In this project you will implement a code to simulate the motion of objects interacting via gravitational forces.
You will use the Velocity Verlet algorithm that was developed in class to integrate the equation of motion for the components of the system.

The project is organized into five tasks, but this project will require to develop a single program. 

TASKS:
1. Implement the expression for the gravitational force and gravitational potential energy
2. Initialize the system properties to generate a closed orbit similar to the one of the Earth around the Sun
3. Plot the values of the energies (potential, kinetic, total) as a function of time
4. Determine a value of the timestep that allows to have a proper dynamics

OPTIONAL TASKS:
1. Visualize the trajectory of the system with an animation, either using the animation module of matplotlyb or Vpython.
2. Include the motion of the Moon or another planet of the solar system.
